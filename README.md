A little tool I made mostly for myself to keep track of my time I worked on projects and to calculate my pricings..
It has a timer to count how long you work on something or you could just manually add or subtract how much time you spend on a project.
You can save and load projects and calculate your pricings.

Currently supported languages: german & english
