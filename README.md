# Commission Price Calculator
a little tool i made mostly for myself to keep track of my time i worked on projects and to calculate my pricings..
it has a timer to count how long you work on something or you could just manually add or subtract how much time you spend on a project.
you can save and load projects and calculate your pricings.

currently supported languages: german & english
